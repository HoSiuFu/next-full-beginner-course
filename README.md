# Next 13 Full Course
## Description
Next.js tutorial by Web Dev Simplefied, find more here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgayZAuTgwM

Technology Stack of this Tutorial:
- Html
- React
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Next
- Yarn
- Prisma (for database)

Despite the tutorial asking for Tailwind CSS usage, I won't be using this in this project because I want to focus on Next so I will stick to what I already know. Instead I will use SCSS.

## Getting Started
Before anything you need to install the dependencies of the project. Since yarn is being used, you just need to run the following command.
```bash
yarn
```

To migrate the changes in Prisma and create the database use this command.
```bash
yarn prisma migrate dev
``` 

To run the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```
